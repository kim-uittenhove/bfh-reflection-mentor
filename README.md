## Chainlit example app for use with ltijs

NOTE - in the root of this project is a file called "rs256.rsa.pub". This is fine to leave as is for testing. However, on production this public key should be regenerated by the keygen.js script in the bfh-chatbot-lti project and then replaced here.

To install / run the docker container:

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up

To rebuild / run the docker container:

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build --force-recreate

To run the docker container in the background

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

By default the container is exposed on 5001
To secure this container with https, an nginx reverse proxy should be used and configured with a subdomain under the same parent domain as the ltijs container.

NOTE - it is essential that the container runs on https if you want it to work with ltijs
